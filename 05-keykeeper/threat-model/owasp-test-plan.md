# OWASP Top 10 Test Plan

| OWASP Category | Risk | Test steps | Expected | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A01 Broken Access Control** | Users can access actions/data outside their permissions (IDOR, missing ownership checks, privilege abuse). | 1) Log in as low-priv user.<br>2) Attempt to access another user’s resource by changing ID/tenant/team in URL/body.<br>3) Try admin-only endpoints and privileged actions.<br>4) Repeat for GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. | 403/404; no sensitive data returned; server-side authorization enforced; denied attempts logged with user + resource + reason. | Request/response showing 403/404; screenshots/API traces; audit logs with denial reason and correlation ID. |
| **A02 Cryptographic Failures** | Sensitive data exposure due to weak/missing encryption, insecure transport, or poor key/secret handling. | 1) Verify TLS-only (no HTTP), HSTS enabled.<br>2) Inspect cookies/tokens for Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite.<br>3) Verify passwords hashed with strong algorithm + salt.<br>4) Validate encryption for stored secrets/PII where applicable; confirm keys not hardcoded. | HTTPS enforced; secure cookie flags; no plaintext secrets/PII at rest; secrets not leaked via responses/logs; strong crypto used. | Header/cookie capture; TLS scan output; sample stored values showing hash/encryption; config evidence for key mgmt. |
| **A03 Injection** | Attacker can inject queries/commands (SQL/NoSQL/LDAP/OS/template) to read/modify data or execute actions. | 1) Identify input points (search, filters, ids, forms, headers).<br>2) Submit payloads appropriate to stack (SQL tautology, NoSQL operators, command separators).<br>3) Check for errors, data leakage, time delays, or unexpected behavior. | Inputs validated/escaped; parameterized queries; payload treated as data; no verbose errors; malicious requests rejected or safely handled. | Request/response captures; logs showing blocked/sanitized input; evidence DB/data unchanged; error-handling screenshots. |
| **A04 Insecure Design** | Missing security controls by design (no abuse-case handling, weak workflows, insecure defaults). | 1) Review key flows (auth, sharing, password reset, admin actions).<br>2) Test abuse cases: enumeration, replay, bypassing steps, brute-force, workflow skipping.<br>3) Verify rate limits/step-up controls for sensitive actions. | Abuse cases addressed; secure defaults; rate limits/throttling; workflows enforce correct sequence; sensitive actions protected. | Abuse-case notes; test traces demonstrating throttling/step enforcement; screenshots/logs of blocked abuse paths. |
| **A05 Security Misconfiguration** | Insecure settings expose system (debug on, permissive CORS, missing headers, open admin endpoints). | 1) Check security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).<br>2) Test CORS with arbitrary Origin and credentials.<br>3) Confirm debug/stack traces disabled in prod-like env.<br>4) Validate least-priv permissions, disabled directory listing, safe default configs. | Hardened headers present; restrictive CORS; no stack traces; unnecessary services/endpoints disabled; secure defaults applied consistently. | Header dump; CORS test results; screenshots of error responses; configuration evidence (env settings, server config). |
| **A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components** | Known-vulnerable dependencies allow compromise (RCE, auth bypass, data leakage). | 1) Inventory dependencies (SBOM).<br>2) Run SCA/dependency scans in CI.<br>3) Verify patch cadence and version pinning; review high/critical CVEs and mitigations. | No unmitigated critical/high vulns in production; versions pinned; updates tracked; exceptions documented with risk acceptance. | SCA report; dependency manifests; CI logs; remediation tickets/waivers with justification. |
| **A07 Identification and Authentication Failures** | Weak auth/session handling enables account takeover (brute-force, weak reset, session fixation, token issues). | 1) Test login rate limiting/lockout and user enumeration via error messages.<br>2) Test password reset: token entropy, expiry, single-use, invalidation on password change.<br>3) Verify session invalidation on logout/credential change; test MFA if required. | Brute-force throttled; no user enumeration; reset tokens single-use + short-lived; sessions invalidated properly; strong auth controls enforced. | Request/response showing throttling and generic errors; reset flow evidence; session token rotation/invalidation proof; logs. |
| **A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures** | Builds/updates/data can be tampered with (CI/CD compromise, unsigned artifacts, unsafe deserialization). | 1) Review CI/CD protections: protected branches, required reviews, signed commits/tags if used.<br>2) Validate artifact integrity (checksums/signing) and trusted promotion pipeline.<br>3) Test for unsafe deserialization patterns if applicable. | Only trusted code/artifacts deployed; integrity checks enforced; deployments traceable; no unsafe deserialization paths exploitable. | CI/CD settings screenshots; artifact signing/verification evidence; deployment logs; test traces for deserialization handling. |
| **A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** | Attacks go undetected due to missing logs/alerts, poor retention, or lack of correlation. | 1) Trigger auth failures, access denials, privilege changes, secret access, and admin actions.<br>2) Verify logs include who/what/when/source/result + correlation ID.<br>3) Confirm alerting for suspicious patterns and log retention. | Key security events logged and searchable; sensitive data not logged; alerts for high-risk activity; retention and access controls in place. | Sample log entries; SIEM/alert screenshots; retention configuration; evidence of correlation IDs and access controls. |
| **A10 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | Attacker can make server fetch internal URLs (metadata services, internal admin, localhost) to steal data. | 1) Find URL-fetch features (webhooks, import-by-URL, image fetch, URL previews).<br>2) Attempt internal targets (localhost, private IP ranges, metadata endpoints).<br>3) Test redirects/DNS rebinding scenarios if relevant. | Internal/private/metadata access blocked; allowlist enforced; redirects restricted; safe timeouts; responses sanitized. | Request/response showing blocked internal targets; server logs; allowlist/policy evidence; monitoring alerts if triggered. |
